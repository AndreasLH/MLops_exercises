Today we start our journey into the world of machine learning operations (MLOps). However, before we really can get
started we need to make sure that you have a basic understanding about a couple of topics, as we will be using these
throughout the course. In particular today is all about getting setup with an proper development environment that can
support your journey. Most of you probably already have experience with these topics and it will be mostly repetition.

The reason we are starting here is that many students are missing very basic skill that are never thought but you are
just expected to pick-up yourself. This session will only cover the most basic to get you started in your development
journey. If you wish to learn more about basic computer science skills in general, we highly recommend that you checkout
[The Missing Semester of YOur CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) course from MIT.
