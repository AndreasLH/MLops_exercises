Today we are initially going to go other three different topics that are all fundamentally necessary for any data
scientist/devops engineer:

* Debugging
* Profiling
* Logging

All three topics can be characterized by something you probably already is familiar with. Since you started programming,
you have done debugging as nobody can write perfect code in the first try. Similarly, while you have not directly
profiled your code, I bet that you at some point have had some very slow code and optimized it to run faster.
Identifying and improving is the fundamentals of profiling code. Finally, logging is a very broad term and basically
refers to any kind of output from your applications that help you at a later point identify the "performance" of
you application.

However, while we expect you to already be familiar with these topics, we do not expect all of you to be expects in
this as it is very rarely topics that are focused on. Today we are going to introduce some best practices and tools to
help you overcome each and everyone of these three important topics.

As the final topic for today we are going to learn about how we can *minimize* boilerplate and focus on coding what
actually matters for our project instead of all the boilerplate to get it working.
